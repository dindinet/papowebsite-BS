At this moment you may be feeling weary and confused. You just want a website to launch your service/product/event but after spending 
some time researching possible options you have more questions than answers. This is understandable there is more to think about than 
'the look' of a website.

My advice to you is to stop thinking about the look, the design, the logo the fancy flourishes and focus on your offer and the people 
who will be your customers. The people who will be presented with your offer.

People are not stupid they can tell when a website does not have any substance and they will just click away as quickly as they arrived. 
When people are looking for a solution to their problem they are looking for that. A solution. Whether the solution is in a 
brown paper bag or a bejeweled box is of no concern if it solves their problem. 

When it comes to getting a website up and running most people focus too much energy and budget on the way it will look. In the rare 
cases where the web site owner is ahead of the game and has all his content sorted in advance then this might be OK. More normally content 
is an after thought. If there is no <strong>real content</strong> to work with the design will be mediocre at best. The designers have nothing 
to inspire their creative juices. The user experience will be a poor one. You lose visitors and they will probably never come back.


A lot of people will make a decision based on price. Everyone has a budget, right? 
What are your options? get a web design agency, solo web developer, online builder hoster wordpress.com or 
So they will choose a package that includes a bunch of stuff and then wait until the website is ready.
