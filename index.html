                    <p>Like all businesses engaged in digital marketing you will want your website to feature in search engine results for your service or product. Your success at achieving this will depend on a number of factors, the most important being
                        your content &nbsp;and how well it aligns with your potential visitors and their needs. All your great content can fail if the pages that present it are poorly coded. Your content needs help to get found. A platform that focuses
                        on building your pages to give them the best chance of being found is essential. </p>

                    <p>There is nothing more off putting to web users than a slow loading site. If you allow your potential customers attention to wander they will click away into the waiting arms of your competition. Worse still, Google marks down slow
                        loading sites in its search ranking. We aim for a page load time of 2 seconds or less. Design decisions have a huge impact on load times. Sometimes Less really is more. </p>

                    <p>A responsive design is one where your content displays appropriately on all screen sizes. With more and more people choosing mobile devices as their main method to access the internet google will reward sites that offer an optimum
                        experience for mobile visitors. There is more to a responsive site than just displaying well on different sized screens. When making design decisions about what is absolutely necessary for your minimum viable website you should
                        focus on the largest user group which according to google is a small screen mobile user with a slow connection speed. &nbsp;Once you get data from your live site and real visitors you can make better decisions. </p>
